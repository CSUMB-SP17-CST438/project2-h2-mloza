## Theme 
Hope

## How did you incorporate your theme within your project?
The background image is a sprout growing from a dead tree.

## Problems?
Gosh. Where could I begin? Understanding React was an issue. But going over
the documentation, it wasn't as stressful. It was just trying to get Socket
with React. Luckily, someone explained it to me. I guess my main issue that
I can remember, was the latest. I have custom buttons. It was harder to find
the right code to make Google be nice with my buttons. But it finally worked.
Google is amazing when one is stuck.

My online users are being counted by who actually logs in using the buttons
and logouts with the log out buttons.

However, the only reason why this project was stressful was because I started
working on it on the 15th. So it's my fault. However, I am quite pleased on
how it turned out.

## How would you improve it if you had more time?
I would make it more eye pleasing. I would also implement users being
logged out when they exit the tab(s) using the session id.

Thank you! I'm enjoying the web dev projects.
